# Task 6 Implementation Verification

## Task: Implement real-time calculation and display system

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **MacroDisplay Component Created** ‚úÖ
   - Located at `src/components/MacroDisplay.tsx`
   - Displays calculation results in a structured format
   - Shows placeholder when no valid data is available

2. **Real-time Weight Conversions** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented in MacroCalculator component using `useMemo`
   - Updates automatically as user types in FoodForm
   - Shows conversions for both raw and cooked weights in all units (g, oz, lb, kg)

3. **Cooking Loss Percentage Display** ‚úÖ
   - Calculated using `calculateCookingLoss` function
   - Displayed with proper formatting (2 decimal places)
   - Shows percentage with visual styling

4. **Adjusted Macronutrient Values** ‚úÖ
   - Calculated using `adjustMacrosForCooking` function
   - Shows adjusted values for cooked portion
   - Displays all macros: calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber
   - Color-coded display for easy reading

5. **Per-100g Density Calculations** ‚úÖ
   - Shows nutrient density for both raw and cooked states
   - Calculated using `calculateNutrientDensity` function
   - Side-by-side comparison format

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Real-time Calculation Logic

```typescript
// In MacroCalculator.tsx
const calculationResults = useMemo<CalculationResults | null>(() => {
  if (!isCalculationValid) return null;

  // Real-time calculations performed here
  const cookingLossPercentage = calculateCookingLoss(
    rawWeightInGrams,
    cookedWeightInGrams
  );
  const adjustedMacros = adjustMacrosForCooking(/* ... */);
  const rawDensityPer100g = calculateNutrientDensity(/* ... */);
  const cookedDensityPer100g = calculateNutrientDensity(/* ... */);

  return {
    /* calculation results */
  };
}, [foodData, isCalculationValid]);
```

#### Component Integration

- MacroCalculator manages state and calculations
- FoodForm handles user input with real-time validation
- MacroDisplay shows results that update as user types
- All components properly typed with TypeScript interfaces

#### Display Features

- **Cooking Loss**: Blue-highlighted percentage with description
- **Adjusted Macros**: Color-coded cards for each macronutrient
- **Density Comparison**: Side-by-side raw vs cooked per 100g
- **Weight Conversions**: All units displayed for both raw and cooked weights

### üéØ Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 2.1**: ‚úÖ Real-time weight conversions displayed
- **Requirement 2.2**: ‚úÖ Automatic updates as user types
- **Requirement 2.3**: ‚úÖ Appropriate precision (2 decimal places)
- **Requirement 3.1**: ‚úÖ Cooking loss percentage calculated and displayed
- **Requirement 3.2**: ‚úÖ Adjusted macronutrient values shown
- **Requirement 3.3**: ‚úÖ Per-100g density calculations for raw and cooked

### üèóÔ∏è Build Status

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Vite build successful
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Component properly integrated in application

### üì± User Experience

- Real-time updates as user types in form fields
- Clear visual hierarchy with color-coded sections
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Proper error handling when data is invalid
- Placeholder message when no calculations available

## Conclusion

Task 6 has been successfully implemented. The MacroDisplay component provides a comprehensive real-time calculation and display system that meets all specified requirements. The implementation includes:

- Real-time weight conversions
- Cooking loss percentage display
- Adjusted macronutrient calculations
- Per-100g density comparisons
- Proper formatting and visual design
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Integration with existing form validation

The system updates calculations immediately as the user types, providing instant feedback and accurate macro tracking for cooked foods.
